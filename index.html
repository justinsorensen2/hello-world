    <h1 class="hello-world">I <3 Video Games!</h1>
        <h3 class="hello-world"><p>I have a lot of interests. I like to read. I enjoy learning. I love playing table-top games with my friends and I play Dungeons and Dragons. I am also the sort of person that has difficulty shutting my mind down or moving on from work when it is time to relax. This flaw led me to search out pastimes that aid in relaxation or that can transport me from the humdrum of daily life to another world. In my opinion, the best of these is the video game.</p>
        <p>Do you like movies or books? I do. I love the way a good film or novel can transport me to another world, make me care about things I never knew mattered or help me see things from a new perspective. Now, imagine you get to take an active role in the story â€“ you get to determine how the events play out, even in a small way. When I have an active role in the story, I am more likely to seriously think about the choices I will make. For me, this involvement in the story elevates video games above other forms of media. </p>
        <p>So, if you have not tried a video game recently, be sure to pick up Final Fantasy VII Remake on PS4, available April 10, 2020. </p></h3>
